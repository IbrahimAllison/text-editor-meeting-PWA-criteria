## Description

The challenge is about building a text editor that runs in the browser. "the app will be a single-page application that meets the PWA criteria. Additionally, it features a number of data persistence techniques that serve as redundancy in case one of the options is not supported by the browser. The application also function offline".

## Motivation for the Project

I was motivated to create a text editor that runs in the browser and accessible offline when I am not connected to the Internet. It is interesting to see how the text editor is implemented from the client, server, and the root directory sides of the application.
